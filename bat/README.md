# BOSH Acceptance Tests

The BOSH Acceptance Tests are meant to be used to verify the commonly used functionality of BOSH.

It requires a BOSH deployment, either a deployed micro bosh stemcell, or a full bosh-release deployment.

See [running bats](../docs/running_tests.md#bosh-acceptance-tests-bats) for how to run them.
